## Without write access

Corrections, suggestions and general improvements are welcome as [issue submissions](issues/new).

You can also suggest changes by editing the .Rmd files that are at the root of this repository and submitting a pull request. Please target your pull requests to the `main` branch.

## With write access

You can push directly to `main` for small fixes. Please use PRs to `main` for discussing larger updates - try to limit to one section or at least one chapter in each PR, so that changes are easier to review.
