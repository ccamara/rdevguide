# How to add Contributor(s)?

1. To add a Contributor to this repository, comment on the relevant Issue or Pull Request, asking `@all-contributors` to add a Contributor:

   ```sh
   @all-contributors please add @<github-username> for <contribution>
   ```

2. After this the bot will create a Pull Request to add the Contributor and reply to your comment with the pull request details.

3. Once the repository Admins review and approve this Pull Request, the Contributor will be listed on the repository.

4. Multiple Contributors can also be added at the same time using a single line or multiple lines:

  - Using single line
    ```sh
    @all-contributors please add @<github-username> for <contribution>. please add @<github-username> for <contribution>.
    ```

  - Using multiple lines
    ```sh
    @all-contributors
    please add @<username> for <contribution>. 
    please add @<username> for <contribution>.
    ```

5. Multiple contributions can be included separated by comma (,):

    ```sh
   @all-contributors please add @<github-username> for <contribution-1>, <contribution-2>, <contribution-3>
   ```
   
## Note: 

- A list of valid contribution types is available on the [Emoji Key (and Contribution Types)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) page.
Replace `<contribution>` with the appropriate keyword available in the `Type` column of the [Emoji Key table](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key#table). 

- The bot uses [basic Natural Language Parsing](https://github.com/all-contributors/app/blob/master/lib/parse-comment.js) to determine the intent of your comment. Hence, your request to the bot doesn't need to be perfect. For example, the following will work too:
```sh
Jane you have written excellent documentation and your infrastructure work has been great too. Let's add `@jane.doe23` for her contributions. cc `@all-contributors`
```
If you precede the contributor's username with `@` as shown above, then the bot will work best in parsing the comment correctly. Otherwise, the bot may not correctly identify the user.
