# Additional resources {#AdditionalResources}

There are a number of further resources to help with contributions to R.

## R Contributor site

Contains information for people interested in contributing to R core, including details for the [R Contribution Working Group](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group), the [R Contributors Slack workspace](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) and upcoming [R Contributor events and meetups](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/). 

## R developer page

The [R developer page](https://developer.r-project.org/) contains information about the plans of the R Core Team and details on the R release process, as well as pointers to technical write-ups including the [R blog](https://blog.r-project.org/).

## R manuals

There are a number of manuals created and included with R installations. The original latest and development versions of these are available from the [R Manuals site](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html). Note that the versions included on the site are created with Debian Linux. While there may be some variation for Windows and Mac manuals,  most parts will be identical regardless of platform.

Particular manuals that might be of interest to R contributors are:

- [R installation and administration](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html) - gives more details on building R from source.
- [R internals](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html) - for those who want to read deeper into the internals R, for example, it contains chapters on special data types used in the C code, internal and primitive functions and details of graphics devices.
- [R language definition](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html) - an in depth overview of the R language, helpful for developing more advanced R knowledge from a user's perspective.

There is a [new re-styled R manuals site built with Quarto](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/) that has been produced to make searching and navigating the manuals easier in a web browser. This site is automatically built from the original manuals site using a number of scripts in the [r-manuals GitHub repo](https://github.com/rstudio/r-manuals).
