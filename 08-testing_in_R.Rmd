# Testing in R {#TestR}

This chapter discusses about writing tests for R and extending the test suite for R. Usually, when one contributes a patch, one might also want to contribute tests that are able to cover the new code.

## When and why to write a test?

Whenever you add new functionality to the core code or any of the packages distributed with R, you may be asked to add test(s) corresponding to the new code. 

If the new code requires GUI interaction or accesses the Internet, then it is essential to add its name to the `stop list` in `tests/no-segfault.Rin`.

## Writing tests for R

Writing tests for R is much like writing tests for your own code. Tests need to be thorough, fast, isolated, consistently repeatable, and as simple as possible. When you are adding tests to an existing test file, it is also recommended that you study the other tests in that file; it will teach you which precautions you have to take to make your tests robust and portable. 

Tests for base R live in the [`tests` directory of the R sources](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/tests/). Contributors mainly contribute to the "regression tests" which are in the files `reg-tests-1a.R`, `reg-tests-1b.R`,  etc. These tests are added after fixing a bug, to ensure that future changes do not cause a regression that reintroduces the bug. If you have been asked to add tests for base functionality (something that is not in one of the add-on packages in the base distribution), you should add it to the latest regression test file, with the highest numbering (currently `reg-tests-3.R`). 

 
## Tests of add-on packages

The check commands (`make check` etc) run `R CMD check` on the add-on packages in the base distribution, so will run any package-specific tests. If a package has tests, they will be in the `tests` directory of the sources for that package.

The base add-on packages use the same form of tests that are used for base R as described in the [Test files]{#test-files} section.

When the package tests are run, the `tests` directory is copied to the check area, and the tests are run with the copy as the working directory and with `R_LIBS` set so that the copy of the package installed during testing will be found by `library(packagename)`.

All the package-specific tests are run in a vanilla R session without setting the random-number seed. Hence, for tests which use random numbers one needs to set the seed to obtain reproducible results.

## Checking R packages

For more detail on the package checker `R CMD check` see the [Checking packages](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Checking-packages-1) section of the Writing R Extensions manual.

## Testing practices

Tests for R should follow the general good practice documented in the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html) manual. In particular:

- Testing the time taken by a command is not reasonable. This is because, one cannot know how fast or how heavily loaded an R platform might be. At best one can test a ratio of times, however even that is difficult and not advisable.

- The exact format of messages from R or from add-on packages can change and may be translated. Hence, it is not a good idea to test their exact format.

- For tests comparing against reference output, use `options(warn = 1)` to print warnings as they occur or `options(warn = 2)` to turn off warnings. In the latter case `tools::assertWarning()` may be used to assert when a warning is expected, see for example [tests/d-p-q-r-tst-2.R](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/tests/d-p-q-r-tests.R)
